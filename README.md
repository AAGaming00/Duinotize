## Duino-coin webminer/website monetizer

Tired of showing users ads? Use Duinotize! It's a modified version of the Duino-coin web miner designed to be integrated into any website 

We reccomend you put a note somewhere on your website to tell visiters that there is a crypto miner running in the background, and credit this repo.

This project is a fork/continuation of https://github.com/VatsaDev/Mineuino as the original author seems to have abandoned it and the code is broken.
